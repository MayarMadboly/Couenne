# Couenne

Couenne (Convex Over and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation) is a branch&bound algorithm to solve Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems of the form:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; min <i>f</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) &le; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>i</i>=1,2..., <i>m</i><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <i>x</i> in R<sup>n</sup>,
                                   <i>y</i> in Z<sup>p</sup>

where all _f_<sub>i</sub>(_x_,_y_) are, in general, nonlinear functions. 

Couenne aims at finding global optima of nonconvex MINLPs. It implements linearization, bound reduction, and branching methods within a branch-and-bound framework. Its main components are:

 * an expression library;
 * separation of linearization cuts;
 * branching rules;
 * bound tightening methods.

It is distributed on [Coin-OR](http://www.coin-or.org) under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0) (EPL). The EPL is a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), thus Couenne is OSI Certified Open Source Software.


## Download, installation and usage

Couenne is found on the COIN-OR [project page](https://projects.coin-or.org/). It can be downloaded with [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org) -- see also some [instructions](https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download#ObtainingtheCodeUsingSubversion) on using svn. Run the command:

```
svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Couenne/stable/0.5 Couenne
```

to get the source code of the stable version. Before building and installing Couenne, some third party packages are needed. These cannot be downloaded from COIN-OR, and have to be obtained independently.
These packages are: ASL, Blas, Lapack, and HSL or MUMPS.
The user is referred to the `INSTALL` file in each of the subdirectories of Couenne/ThirdParty for instructions on how to obtain them.

In general, the stable version of Couenne is subject to slight changes such as bug fixes. In order to be up-to-date with such changes, you may run the command `svn update` within the `Couenne` directory.
The latest release 0.5.7 is also available at [https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Couenne/releases/0.5.7](https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Couenne/releases/0.5.7). This release is not subject to change, and can also be downloaded as a tar ball.

To install Couenne, we refer to general installation [instructions](https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/) for COIN-OR projects.
We also suggest the excellent [Ipopt compilation hints](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/wiki/CompilationHints) page for compiling on non-Linux systems, such as Mac and Windows.
The impatient may want to issue the following commands:

```
cd Couenne
cd ThirdParty      # Read INSTALL.* file in each subdirectory and get third party software
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
../configure -C
make
make install
```

The above commands place Couenne in the `Couenne/build/bin/` directory, libraries in `Couenne/build/lib/`, and include files in `Couenne/build/include/`. An alternative directory can be specified with
the `--prefix` option of configure. For instance, when replacing "`../configure -C`" above with

```
../configure -C --prefix=/usr/local
```

the Couenne executable will be installed in `/usr/local/bin/`, the libraries in `/usr/local/lib/`, and the include files in `/usr/local/include/`.
Couenne is run as follows:

```
couenne instance.nl
```

where `instance.nl` is an AMPL stub (`.nl`) file. Such files can be generated from AMPL with the command "`write gfilename;`" (notice the "g" before the file name), for example.

You may also specify a set of options to tweak the performance of Couenne. These are found in the `couenne.opt` option file. A sample option file is given in the Couenne/src/ directory.


## Documentation

A user [manual](Couenne/doc/couenne-user-manual.pdf) is available, with explanations on most options available in Couenne. Doxygen documentation is also available, and it can be generated by running

```
make doxydoc
```

from the same `build/` directory where you ran configure, make, and make
install. Documentation in both html and LaTeX format can be found in
the Doc/ subdirectory. Fire up your browser and take a look at
Doc/html/index.html for documentation of Couenne.
